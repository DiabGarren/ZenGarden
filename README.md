## Theme

---

The theme of our CSS Zen Garden will be something simple yet beautiful. We plan to use some ideas from Google’s Material Design website, material.io. We think they have some great ideas on how to present a webpage as well as how some of the elements on the page should be displayed. Grids will be properly aligned so that noticeable spaces don’t stand out. Our colors will be almost monochromatic with a base color and then various shades and tints on that color. The fonts will be a Sans Serif for the headers and a Serif for the body.
